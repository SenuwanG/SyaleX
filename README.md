**Problem Statement**

When choosing a VMS, there are multiple factors to be considered. An organization has to consider the size and complexity of the IT environment they come from. If the organization has few hundred asset endpoints, purchasing a thousand of dollar VMS tool will be a arguable situation as the company maybe not even generate that kind of income. This means the organization not only should consider the size of the infrastructure but also look into their budget that they can spent on and what they need as security.
Due to these factors existing products are not viable solution for companies with low asset counts. But for these companies to exist they are required to be compliance with security audits conducted. As they maybe or maybe not store sensitive information of a user/client of their company. To pass these security audits, an organization must maintain a security posture of showing the security compliance audit them that they have a remediation plan.

**Product Scope**

Our Python-based vulnerability scanner was created to help with this critical problem. The purpose of this utility is to automate the process of finding vulnerabilities in Linux systems in a way that is both accessible and economical. Our scanner is designed to help system administrators and security experts proactively secure Linux-based infrastructure by using the strength of open-source software and the versatility of Python.â€ƒ
